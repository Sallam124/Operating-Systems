  length_of_sequence: Number of pages in each sequence.
  
  num_of_page_sequences: Number of processes.
  
  lower_range & higher_range: Range of page numbers.
  
  probability: Probability of staying on the same page.
  
  local_frame_size: Number of frames for each process in local FIFO.
  
  global_frame_size: Total frames shared by all processes in global FIFO.
